 <h1> Hello, </h1>
<p>
<h2><font color="purple">My name is Maidele Archelus.</font></h2>

<p>
My career goal is to ultimately become a Data Analyst. To achieve this goal I will obtain my Bachelors in Business Analytics and Information Systems. I will obtain this degree from the University of South Florida. This is my junior year at the University of South Florida.
<p>
My expected graduation date is around May 2025. Upon graduation I will search for jobs within Data/ Business Analytics. I will also look for jobs that involve information systems/IT. I already have experience in this field as I have worked as Student Assistant for the Resource Management Department at my university. Other work experience I have is being a Patient Sitter at my local hospital and a retail cashier. These jobs taught me how to be responsible, patient, and how to work as a team. As these were skills that I used on a day-to-day basis. 
<p>
At my student assistant job, I gained experience with data entry. I am currently searching for an internship within the Healthcare Analytics field and/or the Cybersecurity field. These are two specific fields that I am interested in working for when I graduate. I am also considering obtaining a Master's in Business Administration to further my education. Upon obtaining my master, I will search for Project Mangers positions. A Project Manager is another position I am interested in. Project Managers are in charge of the details of planning a successful project. This class will help me in my future as the skills I acquire in this class will help me in my future workplace. I will acquire a lot of skills from the projects completed in this class.
