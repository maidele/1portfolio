<h1> Excel 2
 Project Overview </h1>
<br>
<h2> Hello, </h2>

This project uses comparative analysis in excel. This project has five parts with multiple steps in each part. The goal of this project is to compare data in Excel using comparison tables, pivot tables, and other features.  The purpose of this project is to used various excel functions(ie Lookup)to compare the information from the source using tables, graphs, etc. Part one involves copying the medical data file, state list file, and medical data into the workbook.
<p>
Part two of this project is all about the set up of the worksheet relating to the comparisons. The steps in this part includes centering and merging the title, adding colored boarders, background, note, and font colors. Part two includes an input section that has includes the wrapping and shape feature. The comparison area is comparing two different states. This area utilizes VLOOUP, IFERROR function, and conditional formatting. The graph in this section shows a pie graph. Protection is also used in this worksheet section.
<p>
Part 3 of this project is regarding pivot tables. The first pivot table is the total policy score average based on region. The second pivot table is the Expanded Medicare eligibility based on scores and state. The second pivot table is about the State Expanded Medicare eligibility's score and the sates. The second pivot table uses a slider. The third pivot table is one that I did individually and it displays states and policy score.
<p>
Part four of this project is all about filters. The first filter displays total policy that have an average score higher than 5.23. The first filter uses a number filter. The second filter displays states that have correct itemized bills and limit charges to low-income houses. It also filters according to accurate itemized bills. Filter three displayed limit surprise billing that have accurate itemized bills with limit pricing for necessary care along with the filter of scores of 0 only.
<p>
<h4>Excel formulas, skills, and techniques that are used in this project:</h4>
<li> Wrapped skills- Wrapping skill was applied to columns labeled "State 1" and "State 2." These columns remained wrapped even after increasing the column width. </li>
<li> Conditional formatting- This skill is used to display policy scores that are not equal to 0. </li>
<li> Graph- Column graph is used to display the information in the Music Lookup.</li>
<li> IFERROR Function- This function is used to display a message when an incorrect state code is entered. </li>

I learned many useful skills from this project. One of those useful things was how to make a comparative analysis chart to compare two different things. This tool is useful as it can be used for many different states in the United States. This project also reinforced several other skills that I learned from the past projects. I learned specific statistics about state medical policies. For example, I learned that central regions had an average of total policy score of 4.2, east regions had an average of total policy score of 6.6, south regions had an average of total policy of 4.1 and west regions had an average policy of 5.8. I also learned skills such as the IFERROR function that demonstrates an error message. The only problem I ran into with this project is that my worksheet was not protected.
